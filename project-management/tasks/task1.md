# Task 1 - Basic 3D Canvas and Static Pylon Display

## Description

Set up Three.js with React Three Fiber to create a basic 3D scene displaying a simple rectangular pylon. This task establishes the minimal 3D rendering foundation by showing a static scene with basic lighting. No user interactions or controls are included.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: 3D Canvas Setup**

- 3D canvas is rendered on the main page using React Three Fiber
- Canvas takes up a reasonable portion of the page (e.g., 800x600px or similar)
- Scene renders without errors in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari

**AC2: Basic Scene Lighting**

- Scene includes ambient lighting for general illumination
- Scene includes directional lighting for proper depth perception
- Lighting allows the pylon to be clearly visible and shows its 3D form

**AC3: Static Pylon Geometry**

- Simple rectangular pylon geometry is displayed in the center of the scene
- Pylon has fixed dimensions: 3.0m height, 1.0m width, 0.5m depth
- Pylon has a basic material (e.g., gray or light blue color)
- Pylon geometry includes proper faces and normals for lighting

**AC4: Camera Positioning**

- Camera is positioned to show the pylon clearly from a fixed angle
- Pylon is centered in the view and properly framed
- No camera controls or interactions (static view only)

**AC5: Performance Requirements**

- Initial scene load completes within 3 seconds
- 3D rendering displays smoothly without errors
- Application builds without errors using `npm run build`
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Automated Tests

**Integration Tests (Cypress):**

- Test that 3D canvas element is present on the page
- Test that WebGL context is successfully created
- Test that the page renders without JavaScript errors

**Manual Testing Required:**

- Visual verification of 3D pylon rendering in target browsers
- Confirm pylon is visible and properly lit
- Verify scene loads within performance requirements
