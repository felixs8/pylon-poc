# Task 3: Dynamic Pylon Size Configuration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed:** August 23, 2025  
**Implementation:** React Context-based state management with real-time 3D updates

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- **React Context Pattern**: Chosen over prop drilling for clean state management across components
- **Component Extraction**: DimensionControl extracted to separate file for better modularity and focused testing
- **Dynamic Camera Positioning**: Camera adapts automatically to pylon size ensuring all dimensions remain visible

### Technical Improvements

- **Data-TestId Strategy**: Implemented comprehensive test targeting using `data-testid` attributes for reliable test selection
- **Adaptive UI Controls**: Dual input methods (sliders + numeric inputs) provide flexibility for different user preferences
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation with immediate visual feedback prevents invalid configurations
- **Responsive 3D Scene**: Camera and controls scale dynamically with pylon dimensions

### Test Coverage

- **Component Tests**: 9 tests covering individual DimensionControl behavior and integration scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: 9 tests validating complete user workflows and error handling
- **Data-Testid Precision**: All tests use specific identifiers instead of generic selectors for improved reliability

## Description

Implement user interface controls to dynamically adjust pylon dimensions (height, width, depth) with real-time updates to the 3D model. Create a React Context-based state management system to handle pylon configuration data, establishing the foundation for future configuration features (shape, material, color, price calculation). Add sliders and numeric input fields for each dimension within the specified ranges, ensuring the 3D pylon geometry updates within 1 second of any change. This transforms the static pylon into a configurable model while building the architectural foundation for the complete configurator system.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Height Control Interface**

- Add height slider control with range 1.0m - 8.0m
- Add numeric input field for height with same range validation
- Current height value is displayed with "m" unit
- Height changes via slider or input update the 3D model within 1 second
- Invalid input values are rejected and user receives feedback

**AC2: Width Control Interface**

- Add width slider control with range 0.3m - 3.0m
- Add numeric input field for width with same range validation
- Current width value is displayed with "m" unit
- Width changes via slider or input update the 3D model within 1 second
- Invalid input values are rejected and user receives feedback

**AC3: Depth Control Interface**

- Add depth slider control with range 0.1m - 1.0m
- Add numeric input field for depth with same range validation
- Current depth value is displayed with "m" unit
- Depth changes via slider or input update the 3D model within 1 second
- Invalid input values are rejected and user receives feedback

**AC4: Real-time 3D Model Updates**

- Pylon geometry updates immediately when any dimension changes
- Pylon maintains proper positioning (bottom face on ground plane)
- Camera target adjusts to new pylon center for optimal viewing
- Lighting and shadows update correctly with new geometry
- Performance remains smooth (30+ FPS) during dimension changes

**AC5: UI Layout and Integration**

- Dimension controls are grouped in a logical configuration panel
- Controls are clearly labeled and easy to understand
- UI uses consistent DaisyUI styling matching existing design
- Configuration panel is positioned alongside the 3D viewer
- All controls are keyboard accessible

## Automated Tests

**Integration Tests (Cypress):**

- Test that dimension control components render without errors
- Test that sliders and inputs are present and functional
- Test that invalid input values are properly validated
- Test that 3D canvas continues to render after dimension changes
- Test that page performance remains acceptable with multiple dimension changes

**Component Tests (Cypress):**

- Mount dimension controls and verify they render correctly
- Test slider and input synchronization
- Test value validation and error feedback
- Test that dimension changes trigger proper callbacks
- Test Context provider integration and state updates

**Manual Testing Required:**

⚠️ **Note**: Real-time 3D geometry updates cannot be fully automated due to WebGL canvas limitations. Manual verification required for:

- Visual confirmation that pylon geometry changes match input values
- Verification that pylon positioning remains correct on ground plane
- Performance assessment during rapid dimension changes
- Camera target adjustment behavior
- Lighting and shadow updates

## Implementation Notes

**State Management:**

- Create PylonConfigurationContext with React Context for global state management
- Implement custom hooks (usePylonConfiguration) for accessing configuration state
- Use React state within Context to manage current dimension values (height, width, depth)
- Implement debouncing for rapid input changes to optimize performance
- Validate dimension ranges before applying to 3D model
- Design Context structure to accommodate future configuration options (shape, material, color)

**3D Model Updates:**

- Modify existing Pylon component to consume configuration from Context
- Update BoxGeometry args based on Context state changes
- Ensure pylon position calculation accounts for new dimensions
- Update camera target in PylonViewer when dimensions change significantly

**UI Components:**

- Create DimensionControls component using DaisyUI elements
- Integrate with PylonConfigurationContext for state management
- Use range sliders with proper min/max values
- Implement two-way binding between sliders and numeric inputs
- Add proper form validation and user feedback
