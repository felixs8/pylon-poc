- **Responsive**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Description

Implement an interactive color picker interface that allows users to select and apply custom colors to the 3D pylon model with real-time visual feedback. This feature addresses Functional Requirement FR4 and provides essential visual customization capabilities for B2B customers who need to match brand colors or visualize different design options during sales presentations.

The color picker will integrate with the existing React Context state management system and provide immediate 3D model updates, following the established pattern of real-time configuration changes seen in dimension and material controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Color Picker Component Implementation - REVISED

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Create compact ColorPicker component with label and color circle display
- Color circle shows current selected color and acts as clickable trigger
- Modal opens when color circle is clicked, containing full color picker interface
- Modal includes HexColorPicker component and text input field for hex values
- Bidirectional sync: changing color picker updates text field, changing text field updates color picker
- Modal has OK button to confirm selection and close modal
- Modal can be closed with OK button or ESC key
- Use DaisyUI modal styling consistent with project design system
- German labels and text integration using existing germanTexts utility
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, proper focus management, ARIA labels

### AC2: Context State Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Extend PylonConfigurationContext to include color state management
- Add color property to PylonConfiguration interface with proper TypeScript typing
- Implement setColor function in Context following existing setter patterns
- Default pylon color set to current light blue (#87CEEB) to maintain existing appearance
- Color state changes trigger Context updates and re-renders across all consuming components
- Color state persists during other configuration changes (dimensions, materials)

### AC3: Real-time 3D Model Updates

**MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED ⚠️**

- Selected color is immediately applied to 3D pylon surface within 1 second (FR4.3)
- Color changes update Three.js MeshStandardMaterial color property in real-time
- Color application preserves existing material properties (metalness, roughness) from material selection
- 3D model updates maintain existing lighting, shadows, and scene quality
- Color changes work seamlessly with all three material types (Metal, Plastic, Composite)
- Performance remains smooth during rapid color changes (maintain 30+ FPS)

### AC4: German Localization Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- All color picker labels and text use German language from germanTexts constants
- Add appropriate German text constants for color selection ("Farbe auswählen", "Aktuelle Farbe", etc.)
- Color value display follows German formatting standards if applicable
- Integration with existing German text infrastructure
- Error handling (if any) displays German messages

### AC5: Configuration Summary Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Current selected color is displayed in ConfigurationSummary component
- Color information formatted consistently with existing dimension and material displays
- Color display shows visual color swatch alongside any text representation
- Configuration summary updates immediately when color changes
- Layout maintains existing visual hierarchy and spacing

## Automated Testing Requirements

### Component Tests (Cypress)

- Test ColorPicker component renders with proper UI elements
- Test color selection updates Context state correctly
- Test default color initialization (#87CEEB)
- Test German text labels display correctly
- Test color picker integration into ConfigurationPanel layout
- Test ConfigurationSummary displays selected color information
- Test color state persistence during dimension/material changes
- Test keyboard accessibility and focus management

### E2E Tests (Cypress)

- Test complete color selection workflow from UI interaction to Context update
- Test color picker works alongside existing dimension and material controls without conflicts
- Test color selection accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Test color picker UI responsiveness and layout integration
- Test configuration summary updates when color changes

### Manual Testing Requirements

⚠️ **Note**: 3D color application cannot be fully automated due to WebGL canvas limitations. Manual verification required for:

- Visual confirmation that selected colors appear correctly on 3D pylon model
- Verification that color changes preserve material appearance characteristics
- Performance assessment during rapid color selections
- Color accuracy and visual quality across different browsers
- Lighting interaction with different color choices

## Dependencies

- **None**: This task builds on existing Context state management and 3D material system
- **Follows**: Task 5 (Material Selection) - uses established material property system
- **Prepares for**: Future pricing calculator (Task 2 in backlog) - provides color as pricing variable

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Context Integration

- Add `color: string` property to PylonConfiguration interface (hex color format: #RRGGBB)
- Implement `setColor(color: string)` function in Context provider
- Ensure color state is included in Context value and properly typed

### 3D Integration

- Update Pylon.tsx component to consume color from Context
- Apply color to existing MeshStandardMaterial.color property
- Ensure color changes don't override material-specific properties (metalness/roughness)
- Maintain existing lighting and shadow setup

### UI Component Design

**Recommended Library: react-colorful** ⭐

- **Selection rationale**: Ultra-lightweight (2.8KB gzipped), zero dependencies, built-in TypeScript support, WAI-ARIA accessibility compliance, and mobile-friendly design
- **Performance critical**: 13x smaller than react-color (critical for 3D app performance requirements)
- **Integration advantages**: Clean minimal UI integrates well with DaisyUI, easy German localization, tree-shakeable imports
- **Installation**: `npm install react-colorful`
- **Usage**: Import `HexColorPicker` component for RGB hex color selection matching Three.js Material.color expectations
- **Accessibility**: Built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support meets AC1 requirements

**Implementation approach**:

- Integrate into existing ConfigurationPanel with proper spacing and layout
- Follow DaisyUI component styling patterns established in dimension/material controls
- Ensure responsive design fits existing panel width constraints
- Use HexColorPicker component for direct hex string output compatible with Three.js

### German Text Constants

Add German text constants to `/app/utils/germanTexts.ts`:

- Color picker labels
- Current color display text
- Any instructional text for color selection

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This task follows established patterns from dimension and material implementation, uses existing Context infrastructure, and has clear requirements. The main risk is color picker library selection and integration complexity.

**Mitigation**: Choose lightweight, well-maintained color picker library with good accessibility support. Keep color format simple (hex strings) to match Three.js Material.color expectations.
