# Task 6: Color Selection Interface

## Status: PENDING

## Description

Implement an interactive color picker interface that allows users to select and apply custom colors to the 3D pylon model with real-time visual feedback. This feature addresses Functional Requirement FR4 and provides essential visual customization capabilities for B2B customers who need to match brand colors or visualize different design options during sales presentations.

The color picker will integrate with the existing React Context state management system and provide immediate 3D model updates, following the established pattern of real-time configuration changes seen in dimension and material controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Color Picker Component Implementation

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Create ColorPicker component with RGB color space selection support
- Integrate color picker UI into existing ConfigurationPanel alongside dimension and material controls
- Use DaisyUI styling consistent with existing form controls
- Component displays current selected color value clearly to user
- Color picker interface is intuitive and accessible (keyboard navigation, proper focus management)
- German labels and text integration using existing germanTexts utility

### AC2: Context State Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Extend PylonConfigurationContext to include color state management
- Add color property to PylonConfiguration interface with proper TypeScript typing
- Implement setColor function in Context following existing setter patterns
- Default pylon color set to current light blue (#87CEEB) to maintain existing appearance
- Color state changes trigger Context updates and re-renders across all consuming components
- Color state persists during other configuration changes (dimensions, materials)

### AC3: Real-time 3D Model Updates

**MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED ⚠️**

- Selected color is immediately applied to 3D pylon surface within 1 second (FR4.3)
- Color changes update Three.js MeshStandardMaterial color property in real-time
- Color application preserves existing material properties (metalness, roughness) from material selection
- 3D model updates maintain existing lighting, shadows, and scene quality
- Color changes work seamlessly with all three material types (Metal, Plastic, Composite)
- Performance remains smooth during rapid color changes (maintain 30+ FPS)

### AC4: German Localization Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- All color picker labels and text use German language from germanTexts constants
- Add appropriate German text constants for color selection ("Farbe auswählen", "Aktuelle Farbe", etc.)
- Color value display follows German formatting standards if applicable
- Integration with existing German text infrastructure
- Error handling (if any) displays German messages

### AC5: Configuration Summary Integration

**AUTOMATED TESTING ✅**

- Current selected color is displayed in ConfigurationSummary component
- Color information formatted consistently with existing dimension and material displays
- Color display shows visual color swatch alongside any text representation
- Configuration summary updates immediately when color changes
- Layout maintains existing visual hierarchy and spacing

## Automated Testing Requirements

### Component Tests (Cypress)

- Test ColorPicker component renders with proper UI elements
- Test color selection updates Context state correctly
- Test default color initialization (#87CEEB)
- Test German text labels display correctly
- Test color picker integration into ConfigurationPanel layout
- Test ConfigurationSummary displays selected color information
- Test color state persistence during dimension/material changes
- Test keyboard accessibility and focus management

### E2E Tests (Cypress)

- Test complete color selection workflow from UI interaction to Context update
- Test color picker works alongside existing dimension and material controls without conflicts
- Test color selection accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Test color picker UI responsiveness and layout integration
- Test configuration summary updates when color changes

### Manual Testing Requirements

⚠️ **Note**: 3D color application cannot be fully automated due to WebGL canvas limitations. Manual verification required for:

- Visual confirmation that selected colors appear correctly on 3D pylon model
- Verification that color changes preserve material appearance characteristics
- Performance assessment during rapid color selections
- Color accuracy and visual quality across different browsers
- Lighting interaction with different color choices

## Dependencies

- **None**: This task builds on existing Context state management and 3D material system
- **Follows**: Task 5 (Material Selection) - uses established material property system
- **Prepares for**: Future pricing calculator (Task 2 in backlog) - provides color as pricing variable

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Context Integration

- Add `color: string` property to PylonConfiguration interface (hex color format: #RRGGBB)
- Implement `setColor(color: string)` function in Context provider
- Ensure color state is included in Context value and properly typed

### 3D Integration

- Update Pylon.tsx component to consume color from Context
- Apply color to existing MeshStandardMaterial.color property
- Ensure color changes don't override material-specific properties (metalness/roughness)
- Maintain existing lighting and shadow setup

### UI Component Design

- Consider react-colorful or similar lightweight color picker library for RGB selection
- Integrate into existing ConfigurationPanel with proper spacing and layout
- Follow DaisyUI component styling patterns established in dimension/material controls
- Ensure responsive design fits existing panel width constraints

### German Text Constants

Add German text constants to `/app/utils/germanTexts.ts`:

- Color picker labels
- Current color display text
- Any instructional text for color selection

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] All automated tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] No existing tests broken by changes
- [ ] All acceptance criteria demonstrably fulfilled
- [ ] Manual testing confirms 3D color application works correctly
- [ ] current_architecture.md updated with new features and file changes
- [ ] Task file updated with implementation notes and outcomes

## Expected File Changes

### New Files

- None expected - integration into existing components

### Modified Files

- `/app/contexts/PylonConfigurationContext.tsx` - Add color state management
- `/app/hooks/usePylonConfiguration.ts` - Export color-related types if needed
- `/app/components/ConfigurationPanel.tsx` - Integrate ColorPicker component
- `/app/components/Pylon.tsx` - Apply color from Context to 3D material
- `/app/components/ConfigurationSummary.tsx` - Display current color selection
- `/app/utils/germanTexts.ts` - Add color-related German text constants
- `/package.json` - Add color picker library dependency if needed

### Test Files

- `/cypress/component/ConfigurationPanel.cy.tsx` - Add color picker integration tests
- `/cypress/component/ConfigurationSummary.cy.tsx` - Add color display tests
- `/cypress/e2e/pylonConfiguration.cy.ts` - Add color selection E2E tests
- New component test file for ColorPicker component if created as separate file

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This task follows established patterns from dimension and material implementation, uses existing Context infrastructure, and has clear requirements. The main risk is color picker library selection and integration complexity.

**Mitigation**: Choose lightweight, well-maintained color picker library with good accessibility support. Keep color format simple (hex strings) to match Three.js Material.color expectations.
