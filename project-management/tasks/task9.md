# Task 9 - Mobile Responsive Layout Implementation

## Description

Implement mobile responsive design for the pylon configurator to ensure optimal user experience across different device sizes. The current desktop-optimized layout needs to adapt to mobile viewports by reorganizing components into appropriate layouts for small (xs-s), medium (m), and large (l+) screen sizes. This will extend the configurator's usability to mobile and tablet users while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Mobile Viewport Layout Structure (xs-s: 320px-639px)**

- All components stack in a single vertical column layout
- Order from top to bottom: 3D canvas, page headline, dimension controls, material selector, color picker, image upload, configuration summary
- Each component takes full width of the viewport
- Adequate spacing between stacked components for touch interaction
- No horizontal scrolling required at any mobile screen width
- 3D canvas maintains aspect ratio and is appropriately sized for mobile viewing

**AC2: Medium Screen Layout (m: 640px-1023px)**

- 3D canvas appears at the top, full-width
- Configuration panel appears below the canvas
- Configuration controls use the existing two-column layout (dimensions | material/color/image)
- Configuration summary remains at the bottom
- All controls remain easily accessible and properly sized for tablet interaction
- Layout transitions smoothly from mobile to medium breakpoints

**AC3: Large Screen Layout Preservation (l+: 1024px+)**

- Current side-by-side desktop layout (canvas left, configuration panel right) is maintained unchanged
- No regression in desktop functionality or appearance
- Smooth transition from medium to large screen layouts
- All existing desktop features continue to work as before

**AC4: Touch Interaction Support**

- 3D canvas supports touch gestures for orbit, zoom, and pan on mobile devices
- All form controls (sliders, inputs, buttons, color picker) work properly with touch input
- Touch target sizes meet minimum accessibility requirements (44px minimum)
- No conflicts between 3D canvas touch events and page scrolling on mobile

**AC5: Content Readability and Usability**

- All German text remains readable across all screen sizes
- Input fields and controls remain appropriately sized for mobile interaction
- Configuration summary text adapts to mobile width without horizontal scrolling
- All validation messages and error states display properly on mobile
- German number formatting is preserved across all responsive breakpoints

**AC6: Responsive Breakpoint Implementation**

- Uses Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes for consistent breakpoint behavior
- Breakpoints align with Tailwind's standard: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Layout changes are visually smooth during browser window resizing
- No layout breaking or component overlap at any viewport size between 320px-1920px

**AC7: Performance on Mobile Devices**

- 3D rendering performance remains acceptable on mobile browsers with WebGL support
- Page loading and interaction responsiveness maintained on mobile devices
- No memory leaks or performance degradation during orientation changes
- Touch interactions with 3D canvas respond within 100ms

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoint management
- Maintain existing component structure while adding responsive classes
- Ensure OrbitControls from @react-three/drei support touch events properly
- Test thoroughly on actual mobile devices, not just browser DevTools simulation
- Preserve all existing German localization and formatting functionality
- Maintain accessibility standards for keyboard and touch navigation
