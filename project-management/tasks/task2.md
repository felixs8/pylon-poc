# Task 2 - Interactive Camera Controls

## Description

Implement interactive camera controls for the 3D pylon viewer to allow users to orbit, zoom, and pan around the pylon model. This transforms the static 3D view into an interactive experience where users can examine the pylon from all angles, enabling proper inspection and evaluation of the configured pylon.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Orbit Camera Controls**

- User can click and drag with left mouse button to rotate camera around the pylon
- Camera maintains focus on the pylon center during orbit operations
- Orbit rotation is smooth and responsive without lag or jitter
- Vertical rotation is limited to prevent camera from going below ground or flipping upside down
- Horizontal rotation is unlimited (360-degree rotation)

**AC2: Zoom Controls**

- User can zoom in/out using mouse wheel scroll
- Zoom maintains camera focus on pylon center
- Zoom has reasonable minimum and maximum limits to prevent extreme close-up or far-away views
- Zoom operates smoothly without abrupt jumps
- Zoom speed is appropriate for user control

**AC3: Pan Controls**

- User can hold right mouse button (or Ctrl/Cmd + left mouse button) and drag to pan the camera
- Pan moves the camera target point while maintaining current distance and angle
- Pan has reasonable limits to prevent camera from moving too far from the pylon
- Pan operations are smooth and responsive

**AC4: Camera Behavior Integration**

- All camera controls work together seamlessly (can orbit while zoomed, pan while orbited, etc.)
- Camera controls do not interfere with other UI interactions
- Camera state is maintained during browser window resize
- Initial camera position provides good default view of the pylon

**AC5: Performance Requirements**

- Camera controls maintain smooth 30+ FPS during interactions
- No noticeable performance degradation compared to static view
- Controls remain responsive during continuous mouse movements
- Memory usage remains stable during extended interaction sessions

## Automated Tests

**Integration Tests (Cypress):**

- Test that canvas element responds to mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, wheel)
- Test that OrbitControls are properly initialized (verify controls object exists on camera)
- Test that camera position values change after simulated mouse drag events
- Test that zoom events trigger camera distance changes
- Test that existing 3D scene still renders without errors after adding controls
- Test that camera controls don't interfere with other page interactions

**Component Tests (Cypress):**

- Mount PylonViewer and verify OrbitControls are attached
- Simulate mouse events and verify camera state properties change
- Test that canvas maintains focus and event handlers during interactions

**Manual Testing Required:**

- Visual verification of smooth camera movement in all directions
- Confirm intuitive control behavior feels natural to users
- Validate zoom and pan limits provide good user experience
- Test performance during extended interaction sessions across browsers
- Verify controls work consistently with different mouse/trackpad hardware

**Note on Testing Strategy:**
Cypress cannot validate visual 3D changes or camera angles, but it can verify that:

1. Event handlers are properly attached
2. Camera state properties (position, target, zoom) change in response to events
3. OrbitControls integration works without breaking existing functionality
   The visual and UX aspects require manual validation.
