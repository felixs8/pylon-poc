# Task 5: Basic Material Selection Interface

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Description

**COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented material selection functionality that allows users to choose between Metal, Plastic, and Composite materials with immediate visual updates to the 3D pylon model. Created a comprehensive material selection UI component that integrates with the existing React Context state management system and provides visual differentiation through material appearance changes. This establishes a solid foundation for future pricing calculations and expands the configurator's customization capabilities.

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive material selection interface that allows users to choose between three different materials with real-time 3D visual feedback. The implementation extends the existing React Context architecture and integrates seamlessly with the German-localized UI.

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✅

**AC1: Material Selection UI Component**

- Add material selection interface with three options: "Metall", "Kunststoff", "Verbundwerkstoff" (German labels)
- Material selection is presented via radio buttons or dropdown with clear visual design
- Current material selection is clearly indicated in the UI
- Material selector is integrated into the existing configuration panel alongside dimension controls
- UI follows German localization standards and DaisyUI styling consistency

**AC2: Context State Integration**

- Extend PylonConfigurationContext to include material selection state
- Add material property to configuration interface with type safety (TypeScript)
- Implement setMaterial function in Context for material updates
- Default material selection is set to "Kunststoff" (Plastic)
- Material state changes trigger Context updates across all consuming components

**AC3: 3D Visual Material Differentiation**

- Material selection immediately updates 3D pylon appearance within 1 second
- **Metal**: Metallic appearance with higher metalness (0.8) and lower roughness (0.2)
- **Plastic**: Non-metallic appearance with no metalness (0.0) and medium roughness (0.5)
- **Composite**: Semi-metallic appearance with moderate metalness (0.3) and higher roughness (0.7)
- Material changes preserve current pylon color and dimensions
- Lighting and shadows update correctly with new material properties

**AC4: German Text Integration**

- All material labels use German text from centralized text constants
- Material selection integrates with existing German formatting utilities
- Error states (if any) display German text
- Material display follows German text standards and accessibility requirements

**AC5: Configuration Display Integration**

- Current material selection is displayed in configuration summary/display areas
- Material information is formatted consistently with existing dimension displays
- Material updates are reflected across all UI components that show current configuration
- Integration maintains existing layout and visual hierarchy

## Automated Tests

**Component Tests (Cypress):**

- Test material selection component renders with all three material options
- Test material selection updates Context state correctly
- Test German material labels display correctly ("Metall", "Kunststoff", "Verbundwerkstoff")
- Test default material selection is "Kunststoff"
- Test material selector integrates properly with configuration panel layout
- Test material selection state persists during dimension changes

**E2E Tests (Cypress):**

- Test complete material selection workflow from UI interaction to visual update
- Test material selection works alongside dimension controls without conflicts
- Test material selection accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Test material selection performance meets < 1 second update requirement
- Test that page remains responsive during material changes

**Manual Testing Required:**

⚠️ **Note**: 3D material appearance changes cannot be fully automated due to WebGL canvas limitations. Manual verification required for:

- Visual confirmation that Metal/Plastic/Composite materials show distinct appearances
- Verification that material changes preserve lighting and shadow quality
- Performance assessment during rapid material changes
- Visual quality of material appearance across different browsers

## Implementation Notes

**State Management Integration:**

- Extend existing PylonConfigurationContext with material property
- Add material type definition: `type MaterialType = 'metal' | 'plastic' | 'composite'`
- Update PylonConfiguration interface to include `material: MaterialType`
- Implement material setter following existing dimension setter patterns
- Ensure material changes trigger proper re-renders

**3D Material Implementation:**

- Update Pylon.tsx component to consume material from Context
- Implement Three.js MeshStandardMaterial property updates based on material selection
- Use material properties: metalness, roughness for visual differentiation
- Maintain existing color and basic material setup while adding material-specific properties
- Ensure material updates don't break existing lighting/shadow setup

**UI Component Design:**

- Create MaterialSelector component following DimensionControl patterns
- Position material selector logically within existing configuration panel
- Use DaisyUI radio buttons or select dropdown for consistent styling
- Follow existing German text integration patterns from dimension controls
- Maintain accessibility standards with proper labels and keyboard navigation

**German Localization:**

- Add material-related text constants to `/app/utils/germanTexts.ts`
- Include material labels: "Metall", "Kunststoff", "Verbundwerkstoff"
- Follow existing German text organization patterns
- Ensure material text integrates with existing formatting utilities
